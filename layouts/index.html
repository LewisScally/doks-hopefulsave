Due to the COVID-19 pandemic millions of people had to stay home and continue working. This situation put companies, families, schools and many more through a very rough test. People had to change the way they worked. They had to hack from home, and they needed the tools to do this effectively. We were fortunate enough to help by answering the call of duty and offering a free video conferencing platform anyone could use: lchat.co.uk We are hardly alone in this one. Other companies such as Mattermost and their messaging collaboration tools are essential for any form of productive remote work. OnDevs</p>
