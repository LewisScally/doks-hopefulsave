#### To begin, head to the LChat call page.

##### **Once there, under the text, enter your desired meeting name.**

\*A quick note here: Make your meeting name unique enough that it will not already be in use (think "ournewmushroomshow" instead of "mushrooms"). \*

Then click "Go."

However, there is one super important detail you must still do: add a password to the call. This is a straightforward step, and prevents unwanted zoombombers from crashing your call. To add a password — right after you've started the call — click the "shield" icon in the bottom-right corner of the screen.

Select "add password," and then enter your desired password in the blank field (please do not use "password" as your password). Press enter, and your l Chat call is now password protected.

Because a video call isn't a video call without other participants, you need to invite them to join you. L Chat makes this process as easy as sending your friends the meeting URL.

So, in the case of the above example, you would send your friends lchat.co.uk/ournewmushroomshow

Offering a host of features that compete directly with paid video-conferencing tools. For starters, you can screen share, record meetings, and switch to tile view.

Blur Background

L Chat lets you automatically blur your background. This is a neat tool that comes in handy for everything from hiding the fact that you didn't clean your room from your mom to obscuring details of your apartment to strangers. *Please not this is still in an experimental phase and does not support mobile use*

To enable the blur, select the three vertical dots in the bottom-right corner of your screen. Next, select "blur my background."  

Raise your hand 

If you click the hand icon in the bottom-left corner, other call participants will see a tiny hand icon pop up in the upper-left corner of your video. That way, your fellow callers will know that you have something important to say. 

Perhaps you want share a thought with everyone, but don't want to interrupt to conversation. That's where the chat box comes in. Just to the right of the hand icon, the chat icon opens up a text-based chat box. Chose a name for yourself, type in your message, and hit enter. That's all. 

Tile view

To switch the call to tile view, once the call has started click the four little boxes in the bottom-right corner. To switch back, click it again.
